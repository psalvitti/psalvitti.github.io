  <h2>Description of the Area</h2>
  <hr>
  <p class="downtown">
    <span class="title">Downtown Lawrence</span> comprises about 20 city
    blocks between South Park and the Kansas River. This area includes a
    county courthouse, an art center, a library, the city hall, offices,
    apartments, and two hotels. <span class="opportunity">It also has
      many parking lots and attached shops and restaurants with roofs of
      similar height that could accommodate solar collectors.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="eastLawrence">
    East of downtown is an 80-block area called <span class="title">East
      Lawrence</span>. The western half is residential with many small
    houses and a grade school. The eastern half is industrial, with
    manufacturing buildings, warehouses, a railroad station and tracks,
    open parking areas, a rock-crushing plant, and the city's sewage
    plant. <span class="opportunity">Solar collectors could cover parking
      areas and flat industrial roofs. With combined heat and power (CHP),
      this area's industry might also provide efficient heat and
      electricity for itself, adjacent residences, and the nearby downtown.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="westLawrence">
    West of downtown is an 80-block area called <span class="title">Old
      West Lawrence</span>. The southern two-thirds is residential and
    includes a grade school. The northern third has several medical
    facilities with large parking lots, and there is some industrial land
    by railroad tracks at the north end. <span class="opportunity">Solar
      collectors could go on the school, medical, and industrial
      properties, and on residence roofs not obstructed by trees.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="ku">
    Southwest of Old West Lawrence is <span class="title">The University
      of Kansas</span> (KU). Before switching to utility power around 1960,
    KU produced its own heat and electricity. <span class="opportunity">
      Solar collectors could cover many KU building roofs and parking lots.
      And KU could implement a robust renewable microgrid like the one at
      the University of California San Diego.</span>
