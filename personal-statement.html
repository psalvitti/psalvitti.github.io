<h1>Personal Statement: Peter Salvitti</h1>
<h2>
    My Background
</h2>

<p>
<pre>
Not originally from around here! (hint:SPQR)

CTO, IT + Tech Consulting veteran (31+ years), Hands-on technologist + systems designer.

If it involves technology, chances are I've taken a byte (*groan*) out of it! If, or when, you 
require heavy (IT) lifting, give a shout!

Former consultant with a personal focus on delivering business value through rational systems 
architecture and distributed systems design. Currently Chief Technologist at Boston College 
reporting to the VP/CIO of Information Technology Services; helping to set the strategic 
direction and guide ITS with R&D efforts at the University. Particular focus on scalability
+ efficiency through architecture simplification; faculty, student & staff insights via 
analytics and mobility; rationalizing the technology & application portfolio; and cloud + 
virtualization strategy.

I live on the North Shore of Boston with my wife (of 31 years!), 3 kids ... and, oh yeah, 
Chloe and Bruno (our pups)!

"There are two kinds of people, those who do the work and those who take the credit. Try to be in the
first group; there is less competition there." - Indira Ghandi

<h2>
    My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports, or Hobbies
</h2>

<p>
<pre>
All types of cooking (I'm essentially a chef-in-training ... perpetually), WDW Ninja (and not
afraid to admit it), travel, photography (looking to work aerial photography via drones into
my repertoire) ... and, of course, writing software.
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
    My Interest in Web Development
</h2>

<p>
<pre>
Web is the "glue" that binds everything on the Internet. Knowing how to develop browser-based
software is a key skill.
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
    What I hope to Gain From This Course
</h2>

<p>
<pre>
A greater understanding of the role of a "web developer," the evolution of a website, what 
constitutes a "finished" website, and the communication required with the broader organization
when working on a site (e.g., the "bc.edu" project)
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
    Topic or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About
</h2>

<p>
<pre>
Starting with the basic of HTML5 & CSS then progressing to a deeper understanding of the
fundamental elements necessary used to provide a professional look-and-feel to a site.
