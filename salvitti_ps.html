    <h2>
        My Background
    </h2>
    <p>Not originally from around here! (hint:SPQR)</p><br>

    <p>CTO, IT + Tech Consulting veteran (31+ years), Hands-on technologist + systems designer.</p>

    <p>
        If it involves technology, chances are I've taken a byte (*groan*) out of it! If, or when, you
        require heavy (IT) lifting, give a shout!
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Former consultant with a personal focus on delivering business value through rational systems
        architecture and distributed systems design. Currently Chief Technologist at Boston College
        reporting to the VP/CIO of Information Technology Services; helping to set the strategic
        direction and guide ITS with R&D efforts at the University. Particular focus on scalability
        + efficiency through architecture simplification; faculty, student & staff insights via
        analytics and mobility; rationalizing the technology & application portfolio; and cloud +
        virtualization strategy.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        I live on the North Shore of Boston with my wife (of 31 years!), 3 kids ... and, oh yeah,
        Chloe and Bruno (our pups)!

    <h2>
        My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports, or Hobbies
    </h2>

    <p>
        All types of cooking (I'm essentially a chef-in-training ... perpetually), WDW Ninja (and not
        afraid to admit it), travel, photography (looking to work aerial photography via drones into
        my repertoire) ... and, of course, writing software.
    </p><br>

    <h2>
        My Interest in Web Development
    </h2>

    <p>
        Web is the "glue" that binds everything on the Internet. Knowing how to develop browser-based
        software is a key skill.
    </p><br>

    <h2>
        What I hope to Gain From This Course
    </h2>

    <p>
        A greater understanding of the role of a "web developer," the evolution of a website, what
        constitutes a "finished" website, and the communication required with the broader organization
        when working on a site (e.g., the "bc.edu" project)
    </p><br>

    <h2>
        Topic or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About
    </h2>

    <p>
        Starting with the basic of HTML5 & CSS then progressing to a deeper understanding of the
        fundamental elements necessary used to provide a professional look-and-feel to a site.
