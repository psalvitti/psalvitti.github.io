  <h2>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    In 1874 Lawrence Kansas residents had burned all the region's wood, and
    fossil fuels were not available. Orlando Darling built a dam across the
    Kansas River north of town and strung mechanical cables from a water
    wheel to power local industries. Justin Bowersock bought the operation,
    naming it "The Bowersock Mills & Power Company" (<dfn>Bowersock</dfn>).
    Bowersock's slogan is:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="http://www.bowersockpower.com">
    Producing clean, renewable hydropower since 1874
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <q>By 1885, twelve water wheels drove two flouring mills, a paper mill,
      two elevators, a twine factory, shirt factory, two machine shops, the
      Leis chemical works, two printing offices, the barb wire works and a
      few other minor industries... Rebuilding from the ice damage of 1888...
      Bowersock introduced four dynamos that turned raw power into electrical
      energy.</q> <cite>History of Bowersock Power.</cite> To supplement the
    old 2.4 <abbr title="megawatt">MW</abbr> plant on the south side of the
    river, Bowersock <time datetime="2013-05-10">recently</time> added a
    new 4.6 MW plant on the north side.
  </p>
  <p>
    To raise funds for the new 4.6 MW plant, Bowersock signed a 25-year
    power-purchase agreement with Kansas City's Board of Public Utilities
    (<dfn>BPU</dfn>), saying <strong>Bowersock must send BPU (annual
      average power) &ge; (80% of its total generating capacity).</strong>
    Instantaneous power is proportional to (water flow rate) &cross;
    (water height difference). Because the river's flow varies with
    rainfall, the power delivered also varies. To maximize deliverable
    energy, Bowersock employs a <em>run-of-the-river</em> policy. This
    keeps the upstream water level as high as possible and uses whatever
    flow occurs with the maximum upstream level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Energy is stored in the height of the upsteam water. By intentionally
    varying this height, Bowersock could use the stored energy to offset
    variation in local rate of consumption or renewable power generation.
    But this might compromize Bowersock's contract with BPU. Therefore:
    <mark>Until the BPU contract ends, energy stored in the water
      behind the dam is not available to Lawrence.</mark>
