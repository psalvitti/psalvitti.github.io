        When you collect edible fungi, your expertise in identification is all that keeps you from
        <strong>death or serious illness</strong>. There’s a daredevil side to it, a sense of repeatedly staking your
        life against
        terrifying
        possibilities. Today’s vogue for wild foods, spurred in part by famous foraging chefs and a nostalgic desire to
        reconnect with the natural world, has resulted in some popular guides that feature a selection of edible and
        poisonous species. Nick thinks they are irresponsible, even dangerous.
        <q>They don’t explain the full range of things you might be running into,</q>
        he warns. Many toxic fungi closely resemble edible ones, and
        differentiating each from each requires careful examination, dogged determination and the inspection of spores
        stained and measured under a microscope slide.

        Puzzling out tricky specimens is satisfying in itself: If you call on Nick the evening after a fungus
        expedition, you will find him at a table spread with fungi, several frighteningly expensive volumes on
        mycological identification, a microscope and a magnifying lens, wearing an expression of joyous, fierce
        concentration.
        <q>For some species, the colors are unbelievably variable,</q>
        Nick says of one group, the
        <strong>russulas</strong>,
        <q>and they get washed out by rain, and then the exact
            distribution of the warts on the spores is an
            alternative. So you’re doomed, as an ordinary citizen. Because the colors won’t do it, and you haven’t got
            a powerful enough microscope.</q>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Fungi force us to consider the limits of our understanding: Not everything fits easily into our systems of
            classification. The world might be, it turns out, too complicated for us to know."
